# Cross-Chain Gas Payment System

## Problem: Why is Gas Abstraction Important?

Gas abstraction addresses a significant pain point in multi-chain ecosystems: the need for users to hold native gas tokens (e.g., ETH, MATIC, AVAX) on every blockchain they interact with. This requirement creates friction, as users must manage multiple wallets, acquire different tokens, and ensure sufficient balances for transactions. Gas abstraction simplifies this process by enabling users to pay gas fees on one blockchain using tokens from another, enhancing user experience and fostering cross-chain adoption.

## Proposed System Design

The proposed system allows users to pay gas fees on **Chain A** using a stablecoin (e.g., USDC) from **Chain B**. Here’s how it works:

1. **User Initiates Transaction**: A user wants to execute a transaction on Chain A but does not hold the native gas token. Instead, they hold USDC on Chain B.
2. **Gas Payment Request**: The user sends a request to the system, specifying the transaction details on Chain A and the amount of USDC to be used for gas payment on Chain B.
3. **Cross-Chain Communication**: The system uses Axelar’s General Message Passing (GMP) to relay the gas payment request from Chain B to Chain A.
4. **Gas Fee Payment**: The USDC is converted into the native gas token of Chain A via an interchain token transfer, and the gas fee is paid on behalf of the user.
5. **Transaction Execution**: The transaction on Chain A is executed, and the user’s balance on Chain B is debited accordingly.

## How Axelar Enables This System

Axelar’s interoperability framework provides the infrastructure needed for cross-chain gas payments. Key components include:

1. **General Message Passing (GMP)**: Axelar’s GMP allows smart contracts on different blockchains to communicate securely. In this system, GMP is used to relay gas payment requests and confirmations between Chain A and Chain B.
2. **Interchain Token Transfers**: Axelar enables the transfer of tokens (e.g., USDC) across chains. The system leverages this feature to convert USDC on Chain B into the native gas token on Chain A.
3. **AXL Token**: The AXL token plays a pivotal role in Axelar’s ecosystem by securing the network and incentivizing validators. It can also be used to pay for cross-chain gas fees, providing a seamless and unified experience for users.

## Key Challenge: Execution Delays

One key challenge in this system is **execution delays** caused by cross-chain communication. The time taken for a message to travel from Chain B to Chain A and for the gas payment to be processed can lead to a poor user experience.

### Proposed Solution:
- **Pre-Funded Gas Pools**: Maintain a pool of native gas tokens on Chain A to cover gas fees while waiting for cross-chain confirmation. This ensures transactions are executed immediately, and the pool is replenished once the USDC transfer is confirmed.
- **Fee Estimation Algorithms**: Use dynamic fee estimation to account for potential delays and ensure users are charged appropriately.
- **AXL Token Integration**: Leverage the AXL token to streamline cross-chain gas payments, reducing reliance on multiple intermediaries and improving efficiency.
